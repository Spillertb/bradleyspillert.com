# Content Rules

## Voice & Tone

- **Human language** — write like a real person, not a resume bot
- **Confident but not arrogant** — let the work speak for itself
- **Concise** — every word earns its place. No filler paragraphs.
- **First person** — "I built..." not "Bradley built..."

## What to Include

- Real accomplishments with specifics (shipped hundreds of scanners, 1 GW energy project)
- Technical depth — mention actual technologies, not buzzwords
- Personality — hobbies, adventures, interests make it human
- Photos/videos when available (placeholder sections are fine for now)

## What to Exclude

- ❌ No objective/summary statements ("Results-driven engineer seeking...")
- ❌ No soft skill claims without context ("team player", "fast learner")
- ❌ No GPA or academic awards unless exceptional
- ❌ No full mailing address or sensitive personal info
- ❌ No emoji anywhere in site copy

## Experience Section

- Focus on impact, not job descriptions
- Include: what you built, what it did, what technologies you used
- Quantify when possible (shipped X scanners, managed Y GW project)
- Most recent first

## Projects Section

- Each project gets: name, one-liner, what it does, tech stack, link (if public)
- Include personal/hobby projects — they show passion
- Screenshots or demos are worth 1000 words of description

## Adventures Section

- This is the personality page — skiing, diving, running, go-karts, etc.
- Specific details beat generic claims ("Ikon Pass holder, 8 resorts" > "enjoys skiing")
- Travel, concerts, competitions — things that make Bradley interesting

## Blog (Future)

- Technical deep-dives, project write-ups, lessons learned
- Markdown/MDX content in src/pages/blog/
- Keep posts focused — one topic per post
